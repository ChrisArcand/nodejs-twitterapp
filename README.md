=================

A Node.js app for interacting with the Twitter API

###Some notes:

I decided to use the Express framework to make routing simple. The rationale is that
Express really uses the Connect module under the covers, anyway - and there isn't any
need to reinvent the wheel at this point in time so custom routing could be handled later
if needed. 

I also decided to use Jade (something I'd never used) because I think templating is 
a really nice thing to have even for very simple applications like this one.
